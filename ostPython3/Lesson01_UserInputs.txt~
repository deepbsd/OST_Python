Lesson1 Quiz 1

Q1: Why should you not cut and paste the code when working in O'Reilly School
of Technology courses?

It gives one "a feel" for the programming task...  For me, I notice that I
want to "own" the code more if I type it myself.  I am more likely to
experiment and play around with the code if I type it myself; I am more likely
to get curious about code that I type.

Q2: What is a working set?

Apparently a working set is a visual aid in helping the user organize his work
without dealing directly with the underlying filesystem structure.  It seems
to be a more flexible and convenient way of dealing with work files than by
dealing with what may be an unfamiliar filesystem.

Q3: What module and variable name contains command-line arguments?

sys.argv

For example, sys.argv[1] would contain the first command line argument,
sys.argv[2] the second, and so forth.  sys.argv[0] contains the command
itself.


Q4: How often should you write tests for your code?

If I understand Agile programming, the answer is always.


Lesson1 Project

Create a Python3_Homework01 project and assign it to your Python3_Homework
working set. In the Python3_Homework01/src folder, create a program named
adder.py; in it, create a function that takes two objects and adds them
together only if they are both of the integer type. Raise a TypeError
otherwise. Then, create a test_adder.py file that tests the correctness of
this function.

When they are working to your satisfaction, submit adder.py and test_adder.py.
