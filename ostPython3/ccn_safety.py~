This module includes the num_safe method, which takes a text and
returns any credit card numbers in the form of 1234-1234-1234-1234
and returns them in the form of XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234.

Additionally, numbers in the form of 1234 1234 1234 1234 are also 
returned as XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234.

'text' variable is a string taken from the Project Assignment.

text = """Have you ever noticed, in television and movies, that phone numbers
and credit cards are obviously fake numbers like 555-123-4567 or
5555-5555-5555-5555? It is because a number that appears to be real, such as
1234-5678-1234-5678, triggers the attention of privacy and security experts."""
