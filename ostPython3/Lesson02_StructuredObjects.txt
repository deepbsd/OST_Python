Quiz 1

Q1: What is a good way to manage data and its custom behaviors across 
multiple programs?

By creating a structured class object for that data. The data will 
therefore be in a predictable format, with inherited behaviors.  All 
these behaviors are defined in the class definition, so they are 
available to all instances of the created class.

===== Mentor Comments:

right:  row data map to objects and then objects provide the opportunity for higher levels of 
integration i.e. rows from many tables might go in to building up a 'patient' instance, which
then maps attributes to the GUI screen in the hospital.  The object is responsive, has 
behaviors, and then it's time to save changes, the software maps everything about the 
object back to corresponding rows in the data tables.  This is the function of what's called
an object-relational mapper (ORM):  that middleware that gets between data tables and 
the GUI, in the form of integrated objects that make sense to the programmer.


Q2: What is a bunch class?

A bunch class uses keyword arguments to save incoming data as class
attributes.

The lesson examples included a self.__dict__.update(kwargs) method as part of
the __init__ method for the class Bunch object.  Whenever an instance of the
Bunch object is created and is passed kwargs, the __dict__ for that object is
updated with the key, value arguments that are passed to that object and saved
as class attributes.  

For example, if 'b' is a bunch object:

>>>b = Bunch(name='Dave', language='python3')

then, 

>>>b.name
'Dave'

You can also update the class object's dict:

>>>b.mascot="Cleese"

The b.__dict__ will then include the additional 'mascot' attribute and value.

remember to leave a space after >>> when simulating the prompt.  It has a space after >>>.


Q3: Should you include a test for code inside the main program, and why or 
why not?

If the test is small and will not interfere with the operation of the program
being tested, there is no harm in including the unittest code inside the test
program.  For this to work, the unittest module must remain seperate and not
interfere with functionality of the module or its methods being tested.  The
unittest module should not be imported when the program's other modules are
imported into other modules.  The testing functionality should stay out of the
way.

================= Mentor Comments:

Mentor Comments:
A module might have a small self-diagnostic / dependency checker that's distinct from the full 
back office testing suite that's used to develop the module.  I.e. theres a kind of testing that's 
useful to the end user who is not trying to develop the module, just see if it reports being happy
with its new home and able to do its work.

Overall Comments:
Good answers.  See comments.

Q1: What is masking?

Masking is the accidental or intentional replacement of class attributes or
method by reassigning a keyword data attribute of an instance of that class.
For example, in the lesson, a Bunch object had a "pretty" method whose job was
to print the items in the objects own self.__dict.  However, Python assumes
programmers know what they are doing, and it is possible to call something
like b = Bunch(name="Broomhilda", job="warrior", pretty=True)

Python then changes the default value of b.pretty from "key: value" listing of
the b.__dict__ to the value of 'pretty=True' instead.  

Typically, you probably need to protect class attributes by raising an
AttributeError if someone tries to reassign an existing class attribute.

Example:

>>> class Zorro:
        """
        http://youtu.be/gTfdiHxYivA
        """
	def sign_of_Z(self):
		return "Z sign"

	
>>> z = Zorro()
>>> z.sign_of_Z()
'Z sign'
>>> z.sign_of_Z = "X"
>>> z.sign_of_Z()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
    z.sign_of_Z()
TypeError: 'str' object is not callable


Q2: What do the getattr, hasattr, and setattr functions do?

They retrieve, set or reset, and check for the existence of attributes in a
class object.

getattr(movies, bestpythonic) will return the value of movies.bestpythonic,
which should be 'Holy Grail', obviously.  :-)

hasattr(movies, bestceleb) will return True, since movies.bestceleb='Cleese',
naturally.

setattr(movies, bestpythonic, 'Meaning of Life') would reset the value of
movies.bestpythonic='Holy Grail' to the value of 'Meaning of Life'.  This
would probably be a Crime against Nature, however.

==============  Mentor Comments:
Mentor Comments:
'bestpythonic' would need to be a string.  Otherwise it's treated as the name of some other object, like what though?


Q3: What is critical in creating an API? 

One of the most critical tasks in creating an API is to document it fully.
Its purpose and methods and operation all need to be accessible to programmers
using the API, preferrably through the pydoc help() system.  Quality
documentation is essential for 3rd party developers to use your API.

Q4: In "class Monty(Cleese, Chapman, Idle, Palin)" which inherited class has
precedence?
1.Chapman
2.Idle
3.Palin 
4.None of the above.

'Cleese' which is 4. None of the above.

PROJECT
=======

Create a Python3_Homework02 project and assign it to your Python3_Homework
working set. In the Python3_Homework02/src folder, create a file named
coconuts.py, with an inventory class that tracks different types of coconuts
from around the world. The different types of coconuts must have these weight
attribute values:


Type          Weight
--------------------
South Asian       3 
Middle Eastern  2.5 
American        3.5 

The inventory class must have the following methods:
  *add_coconut() accepts a coconut as an argument. Other types throw an
   AttributeError.
  *total_weight() provides the total weight of coconuts.

For this project, you may find the isinstance built-in useful.

You must Include a test_coconuts.py program to confirm all the Inventory class
methods. The tests must check:
  1.That different coconut types each have a different weight.
  2.That if a string object is passed to the Inventory.add_coconut method, an
    AttributeError is thrown.
  3.That if 2 South Asian, 1 Middle Eastern, and 3 American coconuts are added
    to the inventory, the Inventory.total_weight() method returns 19.

When they are working, submit coconuts.py and test_coconuts.py.


======  FEEDBACK FROM TEACHER  =============

Overall Comments:

I'd like you to have Coconut class or classes separate from Inventory which
should not have much knowledge of coconuts other than the ability to recognize
and filter out any non-coconut to be added.

Here's a simple class hierarchy you might use, such that:

nut = American()
inv.add_coconut(nut)

works great, and nut has the right weight.

class Coconut:
    pass

class SouthAsian(Coconut):
    weight = 3

class MiddleEastern(Coconut):
    weight = 2.5

class American(Coconut):
    weight = 3.5

Now you can check if isinstance(obj, Coconut):  where obj is
the thing to add.  self and coconut object only as parameters
please.

For weight, just loop over self.nuts and sum the weights by
reading straight off the nut objects.

class Inventory:

    def __init__(self):
        self.nuts = [ ]

That's it!  As far was where you append all the
coconuts.  No dict need apply.

See what you might do with these new design specs.
I think you'll be happier with the results.

Good work so far.
