Quiz 1

Q1: Fundamentally, what do regular expressions do?

They provide a concise and flexibile means to many programming languages
for matching precise strings of text.  Regexes are very adaptive and are
a common tool for all sorts of pattern matching in text processing.

Q2: What is a common shortened name for regular expressions?

Regexes or "RE's"

Q3: What is the name of Python's regular expression library? 

re module



Quiz 2

Q1: Provide a regular expression pattern that will find three adjacent digits.

>>> text = 'abc123def'
>>> obj = re.search("\\d{3}", text)
>>> obj
<_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(3, 6), match='123'>
>>> 

Q2: If a re.match() or re.search() fails to find anything, what kind of object
does it return?

None

>>> obj = re.search("abcdefghijklmn", "onetwothree")
>>> type(obj)
>>> <class 'NoneType'>

Q3: What method returns the found pattern string in a match object?

Both the re.match and re.search methods return the pattern string in 
a match object.  re.sub returns a replacement string.

Oh wait!  You were looking for obj.group()!!!

PROJECT for LESSON 4:
+++++++++++++++++++++

Create a Python3_Homework04 project and assign it to your Python3_Homework
working set. In the Python3_Homework04/src folder, create a program named
find_regex.py that takes the following text and finds the start and end
positions of the phrase, "Regular Expressions."

Text to use in find_regex.py:
In the 1950s, mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene described automata theory and
formal language theory in a set of models using a notation called "regular
sets" as a method to do pattern matching. Active usage of this system, called
Regular Expressions, started in the 1960s and continued under such pioneers as
David J. Farber, Ralph E. Griswold, Ivan P. Polonsky, Ken Thompson, and Henry
Spencer. 
Your project should meet the following conditions:
oYour code must return 231 as the start and 250 as the end.
oYou must include a separate test_find_regex.py program that confirms that
your code functions as instructed.

Submit find_regex.py and test_find_regex.py when they are working to your
satisfaction.
