In the 1950s, mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene described automata theory and
formal language theory in a set of models using a notation called "regular
sets" as a method to do pattern matching. Active usage of this system, called
Regular Expressions, started in the 1960s and continued under such pioneers as
David J. Farber, Ralph E. Griswold, Ivan P. Polonsky, Ken Thompson, and Henry
Spencer.
