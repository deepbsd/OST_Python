Quiz 1
Q1: Provide a new regular expression that will find three adjacent digits,
different from the one you provided in last lesson's homework. Include your
previous answer.

I don't remember which one I used, but here are four off the top of my head:

"\d{3}"
"\d\d\d"
"[0-9]{3}"
"[0-9][0-9][0-9]"



Q2: What is the difference between re.match() and re.search()?

re.match() finds the pattern if it's at the beginning of the text to be
searched.  re.search() finds the pattern anywhere in the text.


Quiz 2
Q1: Write a pattern that matches a sequence of one or more lower-case letters
between a and h, all lowercase.

"[a-h]+"


Q2: If the pattern "((?P<letters>[A-Za-z]+)\d+ +)+" is matched against the
string "ABC123 DEF234 GHI345" to give a match object m, how would you retrieve
the string matched by the "letters" group, and what would it contain?

m.group('letters')

'DEF'

If it weren't for the very final '+' at the end of the expression, the answer
would be 'ABC'.


PROJECT
=======

Filename(s):  ccn_safety.py test_ccn_safety.py


Create a Python3_Homework05 project and assign it to your Python3_Homework
working set. In the Python3_Homework05/src folder, create a program named
ccn_safety.py with a function that substitutes X for all but the last four
digits of any credit card numbers in a string, returning the updated string as
its result. Use the following text as a sample:

Text to use in ccn_safety.py:

Have you ever noticed, in television and movies, that phone numbers and credit
cards are obviously fake numbers like 555-123-4567 or 5555-5555-5555-5555? It
is because a number that appears to be real, such as 1234-5678-1234-5678,
triggers the attention of privacy and security experts.

Your project should meet the following conditions:

oFor our purposes, it only needs to convert numbers of the form
XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.

oThe program should return this text: 

"Have you ever noticed, in television and movies, that phone numbers and
credit cards are obviously fake numbers like 555-123-4567 or
XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-5555? It is because a number that appears to be real, such as
XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-5678, triggers the attention of privacy and security experts."
Note that the phone numbers should not be replaced!  

oYou should include a test_ccn_safety.py program in a separate file that
confirms that your code functions as expected.

Submit ccn_safety.py and test_ccn_safety.py when they are working to your
satisfaction.
