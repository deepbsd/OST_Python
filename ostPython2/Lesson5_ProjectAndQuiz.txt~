Write a function (not a class) that takes two arguments, a string player name
and an integer score, and keeps a "high score" table in a Python shelve. If
the integer argument is higher than the given player's current high score (or
if the player has no recorded high score), log the value as this player's new
high score. The function should return the player's current high score.
Remember, a function is not the same thing as a class and it's a function
that's needed.

Again, write a separate test module that verifies the operation of the
function.
