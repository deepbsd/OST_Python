    <p>
    The Boot Blaster is your go to gun when you're in polite settings
    but the Cavalry is far away.  You need deep concealment.  It's
    small enough to conceal in an overcoat or on your belt under an
    overcoat.  It might even fit in your boot!  But when evil
    geniuses or mad scientists attack with their spawn zombies, you
    will be prepared.  After all, you chose to live an adventurous
    life!  Such a life has its dangers.  So be prepared with The Boot
    Blaster!  (Batteries not included.  $75.95)

    <p> <h3 align=center>The Vaporizor!</h3> </p>

    <p>The Vaporizor is what you take if you KNOW you're going
    into Harm's Way.  Chasing down vampires or an oversized Hell
    Child?  Take the Vaporizor.  Mechanical killing machines or
    swarms of explosive pets?  Take the Vaporizor.  Plenty of ammo.
    Seldom needs reloading.  Lots of battery power on hand.  And
    even Frankenstein will stop what he's doing after getting
    hit by a blast from it.  Guaranteed stopping power!
    (Batteries not included.  $89.95)
