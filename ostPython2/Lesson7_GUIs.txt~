Write a GUI-based program that provides two Entry fields, a button and a
label. When the button is clicked, the value of each Entry should (if
possible) be converted into a float. If both conversions succeed, the label
should change to the sum of the two numbers. Otherwise it should read
"***ERROR***."

Q1: Why is the desktop regarded as "two-and-a-half-dimensional"?

The desktop must give the "appearance" of being three dimensions.  Although
there are only two dimensions, some desktop objects appear to be "on top of"
other objects on the desktop.  This appearance, called "the focus," helps
inform the user what he is clicking on and helps the desktop make decisions
about which objects receive the action of the mouse click.   


Q2: What is the usual name for a graphical component such as a button?

widget

Q3: A Tkinter application is normally a subclass of which object?
