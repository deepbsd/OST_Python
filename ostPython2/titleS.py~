"""
This module defines a function and tests it using a TestTitleS class
that I define in here.  TitleS in the exercise description does
not perform like the standard Python string.title() method.  Instead,
it uppercases the first character and leaves the rest of the
characters alone.  

The assignment function was:  return s[0].upper.()+s[1:]
However, the standard title() method would be more like:
return s[0].upper.()+s[1:].lower() for each word in the string
And this is my correction to the exercise so it behaves more
like the standard Python string.title() method.

I was not able to duplicate a string like '123s and ABCs'.
str.title() would return '123S and Abcs'.  I could not find a way
to keep the return '123S'
