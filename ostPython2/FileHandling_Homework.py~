"""
Make a FileHandling_Homework project and assign it to your Python2_Homework
working set. In that project, write a module containing a function to examine
the contents of the current working directory and print out a count of how many
files have each extension (".txt", ".doc", etc.)

Write a separate module to verify by testing that the function gives correct
results.
