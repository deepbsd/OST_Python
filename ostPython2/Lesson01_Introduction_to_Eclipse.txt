Lesson 1: Introduction to Eclipse

Project: 

Create a IntroEclipse_Homework project and assign it to the Python2_Homework 
working set. In the new project, create a helloworld.py program that prints 
"Hello World." Hand in the finished program.


See hello.py

Hi David,

There is no harm in including a shebang. If your script happens to be running on 
the "wrong" operating system, it will simply be ignored.

Great job on this. It's perhaps the most creative implementation I've seen to date.

... and "Hello" right back.  You've aced your first Python 2 project.  Fear not, 
they'll get more challenging.

Hi David,

Welcome back! And welcome to Python 2.   I look forward to sharing this journey with you.

This is a challenging course - it will draw upon many aspects of Python, and perhaps programming in 
general, that you may not have seen in your previous career.  You will learn and accomplish much, 
but it will be a significant amount of work.

Here are a few tips, for your consideration:

- The console window is your best friend.  Use it extensively.  There, you can explore the "behind the 
scenes" aspects of the tools you'll be working with in a very safe "sandbox" environment.

- Use print statements extensively to help you understand how your code is operating; you 
don't have to guess.

- Read the lessons very thoroughly; often the clues to accomplishing the objectives appear 
in a single line.

- Resist the urge to copy and paste code from the lessons.  The process of typing, especially 
in an interactive environment, presents a powerful learning experience.

- Reach out for help/advice as best fits your learning style.  My advice is to struggle a bit 
with new material - that's important to making it your own - but don't struggle to the point of 
frustration.  Have no fear that I'll give you the answer.  I can, however, provide pointers, suggestions, 
and clues that can break the logjam and get you moving toward solution.

Above all, have fun.  This is powerful and interesting material and can be savored as such.

Good Luck!
