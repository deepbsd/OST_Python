Q1: Which function can you call to delete a single file from the filestore?

os.remove()

Q2:  What is a "stub" function?

when you're writing a test, before you write the program being tested, you
create a 'stub' program that doesn't do anything yet, so that the other
programs calling it don't show errors.

Q3:  What should you verify regarding the status of the tests before replacing
your stub function with real code?

if the stub program is correctly structured, we'll see failures instead of
errors.  so you want to ensure that the errors are gone and you're only seeing
failures before you replace the stub function with real code.

Q4:  What does the os.path.exists(f) function do?

Tests whether a path exists.  Returns False for broken symlinks or missing
files or directories, True if path exists.  It may or may not be writable, but
that's a different os.path method.  I think os.access might cover whether the
file is writable...  not sure.


QUIZ 2:

Q1:  How can you obtain the last modification time for a file?

os.path.getmtime(pathtofile)

Q2:  What would be returned by the call glob.glob("test*")?

all files in the current working directory starting with "test".

Q3:  What is the value of the expression os.path.split("/tmp/rhubarb/a.py")?

splits '/tmp/rhubarb/a.py' into a 'head' and 'tail' component.  the head will
be '/tmp/rhubarb/' and 'tail' will be 'a.py'.  Same as tuple
basename('/tmp/thubarb/a.py')
