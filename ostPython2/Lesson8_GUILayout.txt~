Lesson 8 Project: GUI Layout

Write a GUI-based program to build a window layout as shown below. When the
frame is resized, the buttons should stay the same height and expand sideways.
Frame 1 and Frame 2 should always be the same height and width as each other,
and Frame 3 should be half as wide again as they are (i.e. 150% wider, as
shown below).  Labeling each Frame is optional / good exercise.

Quiz 1
======

Q1: Using the pack geometry manager, how would you ensure that widget W
occupies the full width and height of its containing element?

W.pack(side=TOP, fill=BOTH, expand=True)

Q2: What are the two most commonly used geometry managers in Tkinter?

pack() and grid().   Place() apparently has insufficient documentation for me
at this point in my journey.


Q3: When using grid layout, which argument to grid can you use to cause the
cell content to align with one or more sides of the cell?

object.grid(sticky=N) to align with the top, for example.  You can set a
variable equal to N+S+E+W and then use that variable.  

ALL=N+S+E+W
object.grid(sticky=ALL) 

And this can align all sides of the cell and expand in all directions.

Quiz 2
======

Q1: Which widget would you normally use to display a short piece of static
text?

Label

Q2: How would you configure frame F in a grid layout to occupy three rows and
two columns starting at row 3, column 2?

F.grid(row=3, column=2)


Q3: Do the row and column numbers used with the grid layout manager need to be
contiguous?
