Project:
    Write a subclass sstr of the standard str type that implements the "<<" and
    ">>" methods as a cyclic shifting of the characters in the string.  It
    should pass the following tests, which you should embody as unit tests in a
    separate test module:

    >>> s1 = sstr("abcde")
    >>> s1 << 0
    'abcde'
    >>> s1 >> 0
    'abcde'
    >>> s1 << 2
    'cdeab'
    >>> s1 >> 2
    'deabc'
    >>> s1 >> 5
    'abcde'
    >>> (s1 >> 5) << 5 == 'abcde'
    True
