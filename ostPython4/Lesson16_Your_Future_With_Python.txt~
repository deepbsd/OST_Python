*** Pat's Comments to me:

Hi David,

This looks really good, and you have nearly graduated. Please don't forget to take another quick look at the quiz for 
Lesson 15.

Now for a little philosophy... 

Helping others learn Python is like good code scouts ethics.  It's how we "pay it forward" given Python 
was a gift to us, for free.  

Not that learning it doesn't take resources (time / energy), but the tool itself is freely downloadable 
and free and open i.e. counts as certified open source  software).

Have great adventures with your newly developed skills.  May they continue to develop and serve you well.  

I recognize that it is (a little bit) premature, but you have my heartfelt congratulations for achieving 
this accomplishment.

QUIZ 1

Q1:  What is the largest Python conference in the world?


PyCon.  These are held annually in various countries, but now they are getting
so large that some people complain that they have lost their "community"
flavor, so they will probably start capping their attendance limit.  

There are regional PyCon conferences, and here in the US, PyOhio, PyTexas and
PyArkansas are some of the oldest and most established.  

There are also local Python Meet-Ups and clubs; I just went to my first
Atlanta Python Meet-Up about a week ago.  (Very nice time!!)

Mentor Comments:
PyCon is a trademark controlled by the Python Software Foundation, and many conferences are 
welcome within the franchise.  All over the world.  Technically, the US didn't have a PyCon 
this year as North America consolidated in Montreal, though PyCons of that size tend to be 
international events anyway.  India, Australia and many others, have had Pycons.  Interesting 
still unfolding history.

And guess words going to be next year -  Portland, my hometown :-)


Q2:  Do you have to know the C language to become a Python core contributor?

From the text:

Do not make the mistake of assuming that because the CPython interpreter is
written in C you have to know the C language before you become a core
contributor.  The standard library and its test suite have lots of code
written entirely in Python, and it needs maintenance just like everything
else.  Your Python skills are needed if you want to join the open source
community!

***** Mentor Comments:

However C is a fantastically useful language to know and I would not discourage 
studying the C implementation of Python -- what we have used throughout this course.

How to extend Python in C / C++ is outside the scope of this course but very feasible, 
done all the time e.g. with wxPython.

But then, LISP could be useful too:  http://hy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/



Q3:  What is a sprint?

Since open source developers frequently collaborate from a distance over email
or newsgroups, it's rare that they might ever see each other in person or have
any idea what the other looks like.  A sprint can happen at a conference where
such a group can gather together and focus as much energy as possible on a
specific topic or set of tasks for the short time they have together.  In such
a setting, a project that might be hampered by distance and lack of clarity
due to the limitations of electronic media can be facilitated by close
physical proximity, where people can talk face to face.  (They can argue
better and even punch each other out if need be!)
