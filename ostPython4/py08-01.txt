# Excluded because a comment.
# This is also a comment, and the next two lines are blank.

This line should be the first of four lines in the output.
# The next line contains spaces and tabs, and should not appear
  		  				
And this should be the second.

	# This should not appear (leading spaces but a comment).
# Neither should this (leading tabs but a comment).
	This should be the third line of output.

And this should be the last.
