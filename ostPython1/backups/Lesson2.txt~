Lesson 2 Project:

Objective:

This project tests your ability to perform simple string calculations.

Create a new Python source file named greeting.py.
Write code that uses two separate statements to ask the user for a
first and last name, and then prints out an appropriate greeting.
Verify your program works correctly and hand it in.

Here is an example of how the program might appear when run:

Enter your first name: Steve
Enter your last name: Holden
I am pleased to meet you, Steve Holden




Here are the files you handed in:
Python1/greeting.py

Overall Comments:

Hi David, This work is advertised and definitely passes the
objective. Nice going. A couple of comments that you might find
useful for future projects: -The missing shebang you're looking
for is: #!/usr/local/bin/python3 -You don't need to do a type
conversion to a string just for printing. The print() function is
smart enough to handle this. -As you have discovered, the print()
function automatically applies a separator between arguments ( a
white space), so you don't need to use your own. 

>>> print("Chicago", "Cubs", "motto:", "there's always next year")
    Chicago Cubs motto: there's always next year 

    You can override the separator by including it as an argument: 
   
    >>> print("Chicago", "Cubs", "motto:", "there's always next year", sep = " | ") 
    Chicago | Cubs | motto: | there's always next year 
    There's also an optional 'end' argument - default is nothing: 
    
    >>> print("Chicago", "Cubs", "motto:", "there's always next year", end='!') 
    Chicago Cubs motto: there's always next year! 
    
-Also, you might consider including a header with your program. 
The first line provides a "hash-bang" tag that indicates which version of 
Python your code was written against. The rest provides a combination of
documentation and "curb appeal", giving your code a professional
look and feel.
