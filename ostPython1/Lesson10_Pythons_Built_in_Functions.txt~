Lesson 10: Python's Built-in Functions

Project:

Filename(s):  secret_code.py

Objective:

This project requires you to use built-in functions to perform character
manipulations.

1. Create a new Python source file named secret_code.py.

2.  Write a program to read a line of input from the user, and encode it using the
    following cipher:

3.  Take each character of the string individually, and make the corresponding
    character in the output string be that whose ordinal value is 1 more than the
    ordinal value of the input character.  Once the output string has been
    constructed in this way, the output of the program should be the reverse of
    the constructed output string.

4. Below is an example of possible input and output from running the program.

verall Comments:

Hi David,

"lspx!djutbuobg =)   Great job with this one.  Sometimes you have to work
through complexity to get to simplicity.

Various similar / alternative solutions:

===
"""secret_code.py Encodes stuff in a mildly interesting way """

s = input("Message:")
o = ''

for c in s:  
    o += chr(ord(c)+1)

print(o[::-1])
=====


"""This program takes a user input and encodes it with a cypher"""

inp = input("Message: ")
outp = ""

for c in inp:  
   outp = chr(ord(c) + 1) + outp

print(outp)

===
"""Secret code program"""

x = input("Message: ").strip()
y = []

for i in x:  
    y.append(chr(ord(i) + 1))

print ("".join ( reversed(y)) )

===

text = input('Message: ').strip()
tmp = str() # empty string

for c in text:  
    tmp += chr ( ord(c)+1 )

tmp = tmp[::-1]
print(tmp)

===

"""Input to secret"""

s = input("Message: ").strip()
mess = ""

for char in s:  
    mess += chr(ord(char)+1)

for i in reversed(mess):  print("{}".format(i), end="")

===

code = ''

uin = input('Message: ')
for char in uin:  
    code = chr(ord(char) + 1) + code
print(code)

Quiz 1

Q1: Question #1:

How do you:

    calculate a non-negative value for any numeric input?
    calculate the highest value from the objects n1, n2, n3, and n4?
    round the value 1.3234 to the nearest integer?



Answer #1:
1. abs(input)

2. max(n1, n2, n3, n4)

3. round(1.3234)

Comments:
Any type with meaning for > and < (__gt__, __lt__) may logically be fed to max()

class N:
    """compare strings purely on basis of relative length
    Note: no __eq__ implemented"""
    def __init__(self,s):
        self.string = s
    def __len__(self):
        """len(N)"""
        return len(self.string)
    def __lt__(self, other):
        """N1 < N2"""
        return len(self) < len(other)
    def __gt__(self, other):
        """N1 > N2"""
        return len(self) > len(other)
    def __repr__(self):
        return "N = {} of length {}".format(self.string, len(self.string))


n1 = N("jimmy")
n2 = N("chum")
n3 = N("Tylenol")
n4 = N("gypsy moth")
n5 = N("much") # same len as "chum"

thelist = [n1,n2,n3,n4,n5]
print(max(thelist))

thelist.sort()
print(thelist)

Runs to give the output:

N = gypsy moth of length 10
[N = chum of length 4, N = much of length 4, N = jimmy of length 5, N = Tylenol of length 7, N = gypsy moth of length 10]


Overall Comments:

This is perfect, David.

============
QUIZ 2
============
Q1:  How do you:

    check if all elements in a list, set, or tuple evaluate to true?
    return the methods and attributes associated with the value 'Python'?
    return all of the global variables?
    examine the documentation of an object?



Answer #1:
1. all()

2. dir('Python')

3. list(globals().items())

4. help(object)

Comments:
Example of using all():

if all([ s.isupper(), s.endswith(".")]):
    print("Your sentence meets the requirements")

... and any():

if any(not s.endswith("."), not s.isupper()):
print("Your input does not meet criteria")

Overall Comments:

You're on a roll with these quizzes, David. Good job.
