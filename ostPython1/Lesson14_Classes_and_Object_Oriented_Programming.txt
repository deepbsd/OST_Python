Lesson 14:  Classes and Object Oriented Programming

Project:

Objective:

This project tests more of your understanding of classes and objects.

    1. Create a new Python source file named doggies.py.
    2. Write a class named Dog. Dog's __init__() method should take two parameters, name and breed, in addition to the implicit self.
    3. Bind an empty list to a dogs global variable (dogs should not be an attribute of the Dog class).
    4. Using a while loop, get user input for name and breed. The loop should terminate when the user enters a blank name.
    5. For each name and breed entered, create an instance of the Dog class with name and breed as arguments. Append the object to the dogs list.
    6. Each time around the loop, print the current dogs list (the name and breed of each dog).

Below is an example of possible output from running the program.

Name: Snoopy
Breed: Beagle
DOGS
0. Snoopy:Beagle
****************************************
Name: Marmaduke
Breed: Great Dane
DOGS
0. Snoopy:Beagle
1. Marmaduke:Great Dane
****************************************
Name: Rover
Breed: Mutt
DOGS
0. Snoopy:Beagle
1. Marmaduke:Great Dane
2. Rover:Mutt
****************************************

My note to Pat
====================

This was a hard one.  I'll need to play around with this some more.  I googled for some other examples 
of "doggies.py" online.  I found one that created "object1"  obj1 = Dog(name, breed).  I just went with 
"thing" because I still don't understand how the damn thing works.  It took me lots and lots of false 
starts to get this program running.  The last error was that in my print(format) statment, I had thing.dog_name 
and thing.breed.  The program burped because dog_name wasn't defined back on planet Dog, but "name" was.  
But once I changed that, everything ran well.  I'm gonna try another one of these types of programs on my box, 
just to see if I can get it working...

Overall Comments:

Hi David,

In spite of your protestations otherwise, it looks like you understand plenty. You managed to put 
together very good project. The process, it looks like you did a lot of good detective work and 
learned a lot about the principle moving parts of a Python class.

If you have any questions about the content assayed here, or anything else related, please don't 
hesitate to write.
