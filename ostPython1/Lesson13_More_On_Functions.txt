Lesson 13:  More About Functions

Project:

Objective:

This project further tests your ability to write and use custom functions.

    Create a new Python source file named caser.py.
    Create these functions:
        capitalize accepts a string parameter and applies the capitalize() method.
        title accepts a string parameter and applies the title() method.
        upper accepts a string parameter and applies the upper() method.
        lower accepts a string parameter and applies the lower() method.
        exit ends the program.
    Store these functions in a dict with the keys matching the function names.
    Create a while loop that requests two inputs from the user: one of the above function names, and any string.
    Use function dispatch to get the correct function based on the first input, and then apply that function to the second input.

Below is an example of possible output from running the program (note the difference between upper case, capitalization, and title case).

Enter a function name (capitalize, title, upper, lower, or exit): lower
Enter a string: python is a Dynamic language
python is a dynamic language
Enter a function name (capitalize, title, upper, lower, or exit): upper
Enter a string: python is a Dynamic language
PYTHON IS A DYNAMIC LANGUAGE
Enter a function name (capitalize, title, upper, lower, or exit): capitalize
Enter a string: Python Is A Dynamic language
Python is a dynamic language
Enter a function name (capitalize, title, upper, lower, or exit): title
Enter a string: python is a Dynamic language
Python Is A Dynamic Language
Enter a function name (capitalize, title, upper, lower, or exit): exit
Enter a string: seeya
Goodbye for now!

Can you think of a way you could simplify the creation of the function dispatch table? 
(Hint: you can use methods of the string type, str, directly as functions that take a single string argument.)

Hi David,

You're more than welcome! No harm in lifting this verbatim from the lesson. Sometimes you just don't want to reinvent the wheel. This being said, there is a slick way to simplify this. You might find it worthwhile to accept the challenge (or might not, your call). I'll skip a few lines before showing you how it might be accomplished feel have to scroll down to see it - I don't want to give it away unless you want to see it.




Here it is. You'll note that the functions in the dispatch object are themselves quite simple.

import sys

# build the dispatch table dict

switch = {
'capitalize':str.capitalize,
'title':str.title,
'upper':str.upper,
'lower':str.lower,
'exit':sys.exit
}

# build the list of options
options = switch.keys()


# create the prompts
prompt_opt = 'Enter a function name (%s): ' % ', '.join(options)
prompt_str = 'Enter a string: '

while True:
    # request the option from the user
    opt_inp = input(prompt_opt)

    # get the option value (desired function) from the dispatch table dict

    option = switch.get(opt_inp, None)
    if not option:
        # option is not valid.
        # will not prompt for string until option is valid.
        print('Please select a valid option!')
    else:
        # If option is 'exit', exit immediately
        if opt_inp == 'exit':
            print("Goodbye for now!")
            option()

    # Option is valid and not 'exit'.
    # Request and process a string.

    str_inp = input(prompt_str)
    print(option(str_inp))

QUIZ 1:

Question #1:

    What is the dict-parameter?
    What type of object is provided by the dict-parameter?



Answer #1:
1. a parameter you can use to capture arbitrary keyword arguments. This parameter captures unassigned keyword/value pairs. It can be recognized by two asterisks preceeding it, just as a single asterisk identifies a catch all parameter for single arguments.
Example: def function(a, b, *args, **kwargs):
    """ *args captures extra arguments, **kwargs captures extra
         keyword=value arguments """


2. dictionary ie key: value     requires use of dictionary.method()

Comments:
**kwargs (needn't be called that -- stands for keyword arguments) will always be the last parameter if used at all.

Feel free to experiment in the interactive console, by defining functions with the optional dict-param. Example:

def test(a=1, b=2, **extra):
    print (a)
    print (b)
    print (extra)

(OK to do more challenging examples --- there's also new syntax where just a star alone has meaning as a parameter).

>>> def test_func(a, b, *, c, d=5, e):
         print(a, b)
         print(c, d, e)

Means that c, d and e must be referred to by keyword,
not positionally, even though c and e have no defaults.
