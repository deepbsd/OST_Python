There were three projects for Python1!

The files are:

1. refactor.py  (outputs to display only if there's an error)
   This is a first test program.  Python2 begins Agile practice.
2. final.py  (requires declaration.txt)
   This outputs a calculation of how many times each wordlength
   appears in a piece of text.  You can add a '-t' switch to see
   the raw data and count being analyzed.
3. final2.py (also requires declaration.txt)
   This program displays a histogram of the data described above.


final and final2 both require an argument:

Usage:  final.py declaration.txt

note: add -t switch if you want to see the raw data rather
than the just the summary.  Example:  

final.py declaration.txt -t | less

You'll probably need to use your favorite pager (like less)
since this output is large.

Usage:  final2.py declaration.txt
